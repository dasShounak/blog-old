      <description>If you are here, I assume you are familiar with the terms &amp;ldquo;network programming&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;socket programming&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>It was a nice Sunday afternoon when I realized that my mid-semester exams are starting from this Friday. So, I decided to start studying, and fired up Google Classroom on the good old Firefox. As always, I was signed out of my college Gmail account (they do this every 15 minutes or so). After 3 or 4 attempts, I was able to guess the password. Then I spent the next 10 minutes trying to decide which subject to pick, as usual.</description>

Along my way, I&amp;rsquo;m also sharing my experience and knowledge here as I go along.</description>
